# Online-News-Popularity
To Predict Article Popularity, based on number of shares. It’s a multi classification problem, Because this model objective is to predict the level of popularity of articles based on number of times article is being shared.

# Overview
Mashable is a digital media platform for news articles and entertainment. Like most such platforms, it is reliant on advertising revenue. This is done by attracting visitors and convincing advertisers that the buying space on the article is worthwhile. The more popular the article/blog is, the more advertisers will want to get involved and the more they’ll be willing to pay.
In this project, we have explored and analyzed data for Mashable articles to develop classification models and predict the popularity of articles. This can help Mashable increase profits from advertisements by determining the article popularity before publication and setting a framework to sells ads accordingly.

# Project Objective:
• Predict the popularity of articles prior to publication by implementing machine learning models to attract advertisers to buy ad space

• Evaluate best model and perform cost-benefit analysis to determine the model which can generate maximum revenue from advertising.

# Dataset
This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years. The goal is to predict the number of shares in social networks (popularity). Online platforms like Medium, Buzzfeed and Mashable etc. publish hundreds of articles every day. These articles belong to certain categories like entertainment, technology, sports etc. and are posted on different days of the week. This project aims to predict the popularity of an online news article before it is published. Such a tool will help publishers and editors in maximizing the popularity of their articles and sell advertisement.
